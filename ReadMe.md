## Important Suggestion

```
If you want to see either only expense graph or income graph then click on the word (either expense or income) above the Bar Chart, which type of amount you don't want to see.
```
```
If you click on the word expense then it will be crossed by strike, means expense graph won't see on the graph. If you click again then it will be shown on the graph. Same process for the income graph, otherwise it will show both monthly expense and income.
